# A revolutionary 2D platformer, renamed to Bug Hunt upon release!
https://futuhre.itch.io/bug-hunt

Background: This project was created for the 2025 winter game jam at Conestoga College.
A classmate and I teamed up to design and ship a game within a 1-week timeframe, and we wanted
to make something interesting. 

Our game follows a rubber duck who is attempting to escape the VS Code
IDE. The game takes inspiration from games where you must reach as high 
as possible (like Getting Over It). We designed the game with speedrunning 
in mind. When released at the game jam event, many people were attempting to get
the top score, which made us really proud of our project.

The Rubber Duck character must use their charge-jump power to get as high as they can in an attempt to escape
the VSCode IDE, and the objectives and obstacles are made to look like code blocks, and the background 
actually looks like VSCode, complete with scrolling line numbers along the left-hand side of the screen
to track progress.
